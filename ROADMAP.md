# InfraToolbox Roadmap

This document outlines the proposed features and improvements planned for InfraToolbox in future versions.

## v0.2.0 - Additional Integrations

### Features

- **Merge File**: Extend InfraToolbox to support merging Terraform variable files, preventing variable duplication and simplifying configuration management.
- **Terragrunt Integration**: Integrate support for running Terragrunt commands alongside Terraform, enabling users to leverage both tools seamlessly within InfraToolbox.
- **Pre-built Module Templates**: Provide pre-built Terraform module templates for popular cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP).

### Enhancements

- **Improved Documentation**: Expand the documentation to cover more advanced use cases and provide detailed installation guides for various environments.
- **Command Auto-completion**: Implement shell auto-completion for bash, zsh, and fish shells.
  
## v0.3.0 - Monitoring and Auditing

### Features

- **State Management Insights**: Integrate a feature to visualize information about the state of resources managed by Terraform, showing recent changes and their current state.
- **Resource Drift Detection**: Implement infrastructure drift detection that automatically notifies when resources change outside of Terraform control.
- **Custom Alerts**: Enable custom alert configurations triggered by specific infrastructure events.
- **Auto-Update Mechanism**: Implement an auto-update mechanism so users can receive the latest versions without manual intervention.
- **Parallel Task Execution**: Add support for running multiple commands (e.g., `terraform plan` and `tflint`) in parallel to optimize execution time.

## v0.4.0 - Advanced Security

### Features

- **Enhanced Security Audits**: Extend Checkov integration to include more comprehensive security audits.
- **CIS Benchmark Integration**: Add validations and reports based on the Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks.
- **Policy-as-Code Integration**: Allow the implementation of policies as code that can be evaluated before applying infrastructure changes.

### Enhancements

- **Terraform Plan Diff Visualization**: Provide a more user-friendly interface to display differences between current states and proposed changes (easier-to-interpret outputs).
  
## v0.5.0 - Cost Management and Optimization

### Features

- **Cost Estimation**: Add functionality to estimate costs based on proposed infrastructure changes through Terraform.
- **Resource Efficiency Analysis**: Implement tools that identify underutilized or inefficient resources and suggest optimization strategies.

### Enhancements

- **Cross-cloud Integration**: Improve support for hybrid or multi-cloud infrastructures with unified policies across AWS, Azure, GCP, and more.

## v1.0.0 - Official Release

### Features

- **Cross-platform Support**: Ensure full compatibility with Windows, macOS, and Linux, including platform-specific installation instructions and support for enterprise environments.
- **Plugin System**: Implement a plugin system allowing the community to extend InfraToolbox with new tools and functionalities.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Introduce an optional graphical interface for managing and visualizing infrastructure in a more intuitive way.
  
## Contributions and Community Involvement
